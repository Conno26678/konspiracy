Learn about Web Sockets on W3Schools, Form Bar Wiki and Google.com

Web Sockets are basically live synchronization


Assignment Description:
Make a teacher panel page that allows the teacher to go through each question (Next)
I'd assume this would have to display all 4 answer choices 
Only one quiz for now
At the end, it would show [we'll get there eventually]

Load new page per question but have each page share the same format

    <p><%= question.text %></p>

    <ul>
        <% question.answers.forEach((answer, index) => { %>
            <li><%= answer %></li>
        <% }) %>
    </ul>

    <% if (nextQuestionIndex !== null) { %>
        <a href="/quiz/<%= quiz.id %>/question/<%= nextQuestionIndex %>">Next Question</a>
    <% } else { %>
        <p>End of Quiz</p>
    <% } %>


    Another issue I had is that the quiz that gets chosen on ready is related to the SQL. 
    How do I make that so it corresponds with what quiz is chosen
